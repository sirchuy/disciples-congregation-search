A Wordpress plugin that provides a search function for all CC(DOC) congregations in the United State and Canada. 

== DESCRIPTION ==

A Wordpress plugin that provides a search function for all CC(DOC) congregations in the United State and Canada. Data can be maintained automatically or through an update service directly from the Year Book and Directory. 

Features: 
	- Templated shortcode setup to allow flexible results design
	- Automatic update features that schedules download and update of congregational data
	- Google Mapping and Geocoding services that allow for accurate location of congregations
	- Manual updating of congregational data, including the ability to add, delete and lock congregational records from auto-updates
	- Query caching to increase performance by minimizing calls to the Google API service
	- Automatic geocoding of new congregations without latitude/longitude data.
	- Shortcode to place a search form on a widget or other page but post search queries to another.

== INSTALLATION ==

1. Upload the contents of the 'congregation-search.zip' plugin to your Wordpress plugins folder.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Provide a Google Mapping JavaScript API (v3) key in the 'Settings' section of the plugin.
4. Place the [congregation_search_form] in a page/post to show the search function.

== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

= Can I restrict the search to a specific region or regions? =
At this time, no. However that is an option for possible later versions of the plugin.

= What if I don't have a Google API key? =
Keys are free to register. All you need is a valid Google account. Go to http://developer.google.com for more information.

= How do I get a URL to an update file for congregation data? =
Email Communication Ministries at news@disciples.org for information on how to obtain regular data updates.

= Will this break my web site? What if it does? =
Every effort has been made to ensure compatibility with release versions of Wordpress v4.1.1 and up. If the plugin is causing 
undesired effects on your web site, please document the problems (including screen shots, error codes, etc.) and email this information
to news@disciples.org. Then uninstall the plugin to prevent further problems. Communication Ministries will attempt to find a solution
but cannot make guarantees that this plugin will work with all Wordpress installations and exempts itself from any potential damage or 
liability resulting from it's use.
